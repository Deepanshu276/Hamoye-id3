***AIM: Analysis of death rates before and during Covid19 (in Germany)***

Now we will commence our project work.
Let's have a look over the subpoints we have to analyze using the given dataset,
1. Preprocessing of the Data: 
    Here, we will create translation variables or Dictionaries for the dataset to make it more feasible for us to operate on.
    Also, here we will create two different groups as per the duration i.e., Before Covid and After Covid categories.


2. After the preprocessing stage we have to mainly work on these 3 categories:
    - Death per Age Group:
    - Death per Month Change:
    - Death per State Change:


NOTE: For the visualization of the graphs here we can use a python package called ‘Altair’. Make sure to look up the documentation on this also.
