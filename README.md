***AIM: Analysis of death rates before and during Covid19 (in Germany)***

Now we will commence our project work.
Let's have a look over the subpoints we have to analyze using the given dataset,
1. Preprocessing of the Data: 
    Here, we will create translation variables or Dictionaries for the dataset to make it more feasible for us to operate on.
    Also, here we will create two different groups as per the duration i.e., Before Covid and After Covid categories.


2. After the preprocessing stage we have to mainly work on these 3 categories:
    - Death per Age Group:
    - Death per Month Change:
    - Death per State Change:

NOTE: For the visualization of the graphs here we can use a python package called ‘Altair’. Make sure to look up the documentation on this also.

The work on the dataset is already done and it’s available on the Kaggle. For this project work, we just have to replicate the work and draw our own insights on them.

So firstly we will do the preprocessing part(It will be done by all of us) and for the other parts, we will divide us into smaller groups which will specifically look for the subtopics i.e., Death per age/month/state.

Please make sure to add some comments in between when you are implementing your subtopics which will help other groups later to get understood easily.

**Schedule:**
Preprocessing: 09 Feb 2022 - 12 Feb 2022
Subtopics: 13 Feb 2022 - 18 Feb 2022
